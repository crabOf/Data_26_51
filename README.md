The dataset contains information on 2,918 enterprises from the OKVED 26.51 sector (manufacturing of instruments for measuring physical quantities), sourced from the contractor verification service "Kompanium." The dataset includes both numerical and categorical variables: enterprise identifiers (company_id), names (company_name), registration cities (city), registration dates (registration_date), indirect financial metrics (revenue, net_profit, authorized_capital), and operational activity indicators (contracts_count, customer_sum, supplier_sum). It also features regulatory aspects (inspections_count, inspections_violations), legal proceedings (plaintiff_cases, defendant_cases), intellectual property metrics (trademarks_count, licenses_count), and organizational characteristics (branches_count, representatives_count). A notable feature is the use of proxy indicators instead of traditional financial metrics, as many enterprises—particularly those involved in defense and critical infrastructure—do not disclose detailed financial reports. Instead, the data relies on publicly available information, such as government procurement contracts, court cases, and intellectual property registrations. The dataset spans enterprises with diverse specializations, including both subcategories of OKVED 26.51 (26.51.10 for pressure measurement instruments and 26.51.20 for other measurement devices), reflecting the expanded scope of the analysis. Some variables contain missing values due to the confidentiality of financial reporting for defense-related companies. All data is synchronized with official state databases (Federal Tax Service, Rospatent, and government procurement records), ensuring legal reliability while compensating for the absence of traditional financial metrics.
